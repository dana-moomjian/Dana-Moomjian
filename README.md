<h1>Hi, I'm Dana!
I am a third-year student at the University of Connecticut studying Business Data Analytics.
I enjoy turning messy data into meaningful insights and using analysis to better understand
real-world trends. I am currently seeking internships and hands-on opportunities in data analytics.
